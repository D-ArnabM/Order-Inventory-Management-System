<h3>SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE</h3>
<p>             User Interaction The frontend layer of the order inventory system is responsible for the user interface and user experience. It includes components such as web pages, forms, buttons, and menus that allow users to interact with the system.
                Sending Requests: When a user performs an action, such as updating an order or updating inventory, the frontend layer sends a request to the backend layer.

<h3>BACKEND - DATABASE INTERACTION</h3>
<p>The backend layer handles the business logic, data processing, and system functionality. It receives requests from the frontend layer, processes them, and interacts with the database to retrieve or modify data.Â 
	It sends database queries or commands to the database management system (DBMS) to perform operations such as retrieving product details, updating inventory levels, or storing order information.

<h3>DATABASE</h3>
